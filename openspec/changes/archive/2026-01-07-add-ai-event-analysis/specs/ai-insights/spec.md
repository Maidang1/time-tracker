## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: Global Event Mood Insights
The system MUST provide an "AI 洞察" entry on the home page that summarizes stored events via DeepSeek, emphasizing event directions, inferred mood, and hobbies.
- MUST expose a visible trigger on `/pages/index` that opens an analysis surface without navigating away.
- MUST collect up to the latest 10 events (including key stats/records) and combine them with a base prompt focused on event types/directions and persona inference.
- MUST allow the user to input optional free-form instructions before requesting analysis; combine base + user prompt when sending to DeepSeek.
- Response UI MUST show loading, success, and error states, and tag the output as "来自 DeepSeek".

#### Scenario: User requests all-event analysis with custom prompt
- **GIVEN** DeepSeek credentials are configured and there are at least 2 events stored
- **WHEN** the user opens the AI 洞察 panel on the home page, enters "更关注我的户外活动" in the prompt box, and taps "生成分析"
- **THEN** the app composes the default mood/type prompt with the user text, sends the aggregated events to DeepSeek, and
- **AND** the panel shows a loading state until a response arrives
- **AND** once complete, displays the AI summary referencing event types, inferred moods/hobbies, and marks the message as generated by DeepSeek.

### Requirement: Event-Level Engagement Insight
The event detail screen MUST let users invoke DeepSeek to analyze that event's records (duration trends, note changes) and report engagement level, optionally guided by a user prompt.
- MUST present an AI analysis section near the top of the event detail view with scope-label text referencing the event title.
- MUST summarize the event's records (durations, order, note snippets) and compute simple stats (total time, avg, change over time) client-side before calling DeepSeek.
- MUST allow the user to provide extra instructions; combine them with the default engagement prompt.
- MUST show result text plus any emphasis (e.g., "投入程度", "建议") and provide retry/error UI.

#### Scenario: Event insight analyzes records trend
- **GIVEN** an event has at least 3 records with varying durations and notes
- **WHEN** the user taps the AI insight action, optionally adds custom prompt text, and confirms the request
- **THEN** the app sends the event summary data + merged prompt to DeepSeek, shows progress, and
- **AND** after success, renders the AI narrative describing duration changes, note themes, and engagement assessment for that event.

### Requirement: Prompt + Response UX Consistency
Both AI analyses MUST reuse a shared UI pattern for prompt input, invocation, and result display to keep user experience cohesive.
- MUST use the same component or visual style for prompt entry (label, multiline input, "生成" primary action, disable state) in both contexts.
- MUST persist the user's last free-form prompt text per context while the panel stays open, clearing it only when the user resets.
- MUST handle missing DeepSeek configuration by disabling the action and surfacing guidance on how to configure it.

#### Scenario: Missing DeepSeek config disables actions
- **GIVEN** the app is launched without `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`
- **WHEN** the user visits either the home page or event detail page
- **THEN** the AI analysis trigger is visible but disabled, with a tooltip or inline message explaining DeepSeek is not configured and how to set it up.
